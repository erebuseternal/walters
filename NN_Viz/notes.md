Built a neural net from scratch. Couple of things for the future:
- A single negative sign that was supposed to be positive (and was written as negative in the lecture I was referring to) kept me from getting past a bug for about an hour. Super annoying, but just be careful in the future.
- Hyper parameters are a bitch... was getting nothing from this, bumped up the learning parameter like crazy and boom! we got the separation I was looking for.
