## Building Environments

### November 13, 2019
I just built the gridworld environment and it took me way too long. Ended up rewriting it over and over again because I didn't take any time to design the class. Started with numpy arrays for state, then switched to tuples, then switched to instance parameters. Each time I had to refactor a whole bunch of methods. I also kept rewriting which methods I needed over and over again. Next time I should definitely design what I'm going to do and what the data structures will be first.

#### Goals for Next Time
- Build the time difference method (the other methods seem totally inapplicable to any real world problems and I need to get onto the methods we're actually going to use)
